# Day-16
## Contents: 
- OOPS(Object oriented Programming) : In this pradigm of programming , we create classes and use their objects to perform operations. 
- Class : Classes are blueprints to create things. They contain : 
  - Attributes : Python variables belonging to the class and are changeable for each object(accessed using Dot operator). 
  - Methods : Python functions associated with the class. 
- Object : Objects are an encapsulation of variables and functions into a single entity. \
Objects get their variables and functions from classes. Classes are essentially a template to create your objects.
